# Android Skills for Claude Code

Claude Code skills for Android and KMP development — covering architecture, testing, debugging, Jetpack Compose, coroutines, flows, and RxJava migration.

## Skills

### `android-dev`
Senior Android engineering knowledge and best practices for Android and KMP projects. Covers architecture, code quality, and platform-specific patterns.

### `android-tdd`
Test-driven development for Android/KMP — extends TDD with Android's three-tier test model, fake-first strategy, coroutine testing, and Compose UI testing.

### `android-ux`
Material Design 3 UX principles for Android — touch targets (48×48dp), 8dp spacing grid, navigation patterns (Bottom Bar, Rail, Drawer), safe area handling, accessibility, animation timing, and keyboard input types.

### `android-debugging`
Debugging Android and KMP issues — Logcat, ADB, ANR traces, R8 stack trace decoding, memory leaks, Gradle build failures, and Compose recomposition bugs.

### `jetpack-compose-expert-skill`
Jetpack Compose expert guidance — state management (`@Composable`, `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, `derivedStateOf`, state hoisting), Modifier chains, lazy lists, navigation, animation, side effects, theming, accessibility, and performance optimization.

### `aosp-search`
Verify Android framework internals, find `@hide` APIs and internal constants, confirm underdocumented behavior, and trace how framework classes actually implement things.

### `kotlin-coroutines`
Dispatcher selection, scope management, structured concurrency, cancellation, exception handling, and Android/KMP async patterns. Includes the DispatcherProvider pattern for testable dispatcher injection.

### `kotlin-flows`
Flow type selection (`Flow`/`StateFlow`/`SharedFlow`), operator chains, callback bridging, lifecycle-safe collection, Channel migration, and UI state management.

### `rxjava-migration`
Triggered only when you explicitly ask to migrate. Assesses complexity, maps RxJava types and operators to coroutines equivalents, and provides interop patterns for incremental migration.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Copy the skill directories into your Claude Code skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcosteira79/android-skills.git
cp -r android-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills are invoked automatically based on context:

- Working on Android or KMP code → `android-dev` skill activates
- Writing or fixing tests → `android-tdd` skill activates
- Debugging Android issues → `android-debugging` skill activates
- Designing or reviewing Android UI → `android-ux` skill activates
- Working with Compose → `jetpack-compose-expert-skill` activates
- Verifying framework internals → `aosp-search` skill activates
- Working with coroutines → `kotlin-coroutines` skill activates
- Working with Flow/StateFlow/SharedFlow → `kotlin-flows` skill activates
- Migrating from RxJava → ask Claude to migrate, `rxjava-migration` skill activates

### Cursor, Windsurf, and other agentic editors

The skills are plain markdown files. Copy the content of whichever `SKILL.md` files are relevant into your editor's context mechanism:

- **Cursor** — add to `.cursor/rules/` as `.mdc` files
- **Windsurf** — add to `.windsurf/rules/` as `.md` files
- **Copilot** — add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Other editors** — paste into your project's custom instructions or context file

Each skill is self-contained and can be used independently.
